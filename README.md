Orchid
======

Orchid is a Tor client implementation and library written in pure Java.  Orchid's strength is that it can be used to Tor-ify Java and JVM applications with near transparency.

It was written from the Tor specification documents, which are available [here](https://www.torproject.org/docs/documentation.html.en#DesignDoc).

Orchid runs on Java 5+ and the Android devices.
